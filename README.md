🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis for India

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 cases in India using real-world time-series datasets. The goal is to understand the spread of the virus, identify trends, visualize patterns, and extract meaningful insights from the data.

📌 Project Overview

This analysis includes:

Loading and cleaning COVID-19 time-series data

Processing daily and cumulative numbers

Visualizing trends in confirmed, recovered, and death cases

Computing growth rates and active cases

Identifying peak periods of spread

Generating graphs for better understanding of the pandemic progression

The project is useful for students, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the COVID-19 dynamics in India.

📂 Dataset Used

The data is taken from Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Dataset, which is publicly available on GitHub.

Dataset includes:

Confirmed Cases

Recovered Cases

Death Cases

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Key Features

Time-series visualization of COVID-19 spread in India

Daily vs cumulative trend comparison

Calculation of active cases

Analysis of infection growth rate

Clean, well-commented Python code

Graphs and plots for better interpretation

📈 Sample Output

✔️ Line plots for confirmed, recovered, and death cases
✔️ Active cases graph
✔️ Growth rate pattern
✔️ Peak analysis


📚 Results & Insights

India saw rapid exponential growth during the early waves

Recovery rate increased steadily over time

Active cases dropped once vaccination and control measures increased

Visual patterns highlight major peaks like the Delta wave

📝 Future Work

Adding SEIR/epidemiological model simulations

State-wise comparison

Forecasting using ML models

Dashboard creation using Plotly/Streamlit
